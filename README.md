Credit risk plays a major role in the banking industry business. Banks' main activities involve granting loan, credit card, investment, mortgage, and others. Credit card has been one of the most booming financial services by banks over the past years. However, with the growing number of credit card users, banks have been facing an escalating credit card default rate. As such data analytics can provide solutions to tackle the current phenomenon and management credit risks. This paper provides a performance evaluation of credit card default prediction. Thus, logistic regression, part decision tree, and random forest are used to test the variable in predicting credit default and random forest proved to have the higher accuracy and area under the curve.


This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments

Objective of our project is to predict which customer might default in upcoming months. Before going any further let's have a quick look on definition of what actually meant by Credit Card Default. We are all aware what is credit card. It is type of payment card in which charges are made against a line of credit instead of the account holder's cash deposits. When someone uses a credit card to make a purchase, that person's account accrues a balance that must be paid off each month. Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent (usually a young person who regularly performs illegal or immoral acts) on your credit card payments. Missing credit card payments once or twice does not count as a default. A payment default occurs when you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due on the credit card for a few consecutive months.

The first dataset is the Credit Card dataset, where we had records from Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. This dataset was highly imbalanced and needed resampling or transformation. We used standard scaler to transform our train and test data. After applying 6 machine learning models with normal data and transformed data, it can be easily observed that the performance of all models was good with transformed train and test data.


We first described the general trends in our results and then analyzed these general trends. The clients we are trying to classify our account holders, so we have enough information about them. Without knowing anything about the client’s spending patterns, it is hard to separate clients that have no intention of paying their debt from the clients that are merely taking advantage of the credit and will pay back later. Since we are making predictions based on salary statements of the previous quarter, bill payments of the previous quarter, and repayment status of the last quarter to predict delinquency in the next quarter, it is reassuring to see that credit amount, marital status, and education level are also significant features for our prediction problem. These features were generated by aggregating the data in the statement’s dataset


After applying classification model, we can conclude that after that we build the six models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boosting, Support Vector Classifier, K-Neighbor Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and we obtained the best accuracy from Random Forest Classifier. Using a Logistic Regression classifier, we can predict an accuracy of 68.63%.


Using a Logistic Regression classifier, we can predict an accuracy of 69%.


Using Random Forest Classifier, we can predict an accuracy of 88.%.

Using K-Neighbor Classifier, we can predict an accuracy of 79% .

Using Support Vector Machine Classifier, we can predict an accuracy of 78% .

Using XG Boosting, we can predict an accuracy of 77%.

Using Decision Tree Classifier, we can predict an accuracy of 77%.

Random Forest Classifier performs best among all models.

Logistic Regression are not giving good precision score.

Top 3 models are Random Forest, K-Neighbor Classifier and Support Vector Classifier that gives best Precision, Recall, ROC_AUC and F1 score.
